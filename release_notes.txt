Release Notes
---


> v0.1:

- Initial release.
- Local content streaming (via NCP, NCMS, etc.) is well tested and expected to be stable.
- Video formats (containers) are mostly untested and not recommended for streaming.
- Internet radio streams generally work, but require a good (low-latency) WiFi connection.
- Multi-room audio playback (via NCP group) has been somewhat tested.

**Experimental features:**
- These features may or may not work reliably. Feedback is welcome.
- Internet radio streams: can be choppy, cut out or hang.
- Multi-room audio: synchronisation may be off between slaves.
