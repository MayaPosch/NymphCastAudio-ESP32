NymphCast Audio - ESP32

Test protocol

---

Commissioning the NCA-ESP32 project requires it to pass a number of tests, which are defined in this document.

Test setup: Wired (Ethernet) on NC client system, ESP32-S3 connected via WiFi (same subnet).

---

== T0. Playback ==

> T0.1. Media from NC client

1. Playback of varied audio formats at max bitrate: 
	1. MP3 	=> Works.
	2. WAV	=> Filter buffer issue in log fixed with CONFIG_AVFILTER=1 in simulator. Works on HW.
	3. OGG	=> System crash => Enabled MDCT in FFmpeg, works in sim & HW.
	4. FLAC	=> Works => Works in simulator & HW.
	5. APE	=> Works in sim. 32-bit APE not supported. HW: ?
	6. WMA	=> System crash like with Ogg. => Enabled MDCT in FFmpeg, works in sim. HW: ?
	7. AAC	=> Works.
	
Notes:
	- Simulator is the WalkFox Sim, with local read-out of meta data & position info.
	- Position keeps getting reset to 0:00 by NCA update in client with OGG & FLAC.
		=> Fixed by calling video refresh function.
	- WAV gives the abuffersink error in log, then playback hangs until stopped.
	- Sample rate for I2S is fixed at 44.1 kHz, causes issues with e.g. 48 kHz files.
		=> Fixed in sdl_dummy: return correct sample rate to player.

2. Playback of various video formats (video & audio streams, audio-only output):
	1. MKV
	2. AVI
	3. WEBM (MKV derivative).
	4. MP4
	5.
	
> T0.2. Streaming from URL.
	1. Streaming of common stream formats (RTSP, HTTP(S)).
		=> System crash due to missing protocols. HTTPS works after adding HTTPS support to FFmpeg.
		=> Used getnameinfo() from: https://git.tu-berlin.de/felixmoebius/lib-lwip/-/blob/main/getnameinfo.c
		1. HTTPS	=> Works.
		2. HTTP		=> ?
		3. RTSP		=> ? (may need protocol added in ffmpeg).

Criteria:
	1. Smooth playback, no audio artefacts.
	2. Ability to pause, resume and stop without glitches or artefacts.
	
	
== T1. Multi-room ==

1. Connect to multiple NCA-ESP32 instances.
2. Play back media formats as per T0.1.1 & T0.1.2 with T0.1 criteria.
3. Use 1+ NCA-ESP32 as slaves with a non-NCA-ESP32 NymphCast server as master:
	a. With regular playback.
	b. With NymphCast Apps.

Additional criteria:
	1. Synchronisation between the different NCA-ESP32 instances.
	
	
--- General Remarks ---

1. Some crackling on boot: add usage of Mute pin to hardware design.
2.
