NymphCast Audio - ESP32

Test protocol

---

Commissioning the NCA-ESP32 project requires it to pass a number of tests, which are defined in this document.

Test setup: Wired (Ethernet) on NC client system, ESP32-S3 connected via WiFi (same subnet).

---

== T0. Playback ==

> T0.1. Media from NC client

1. Playback of varied audio formats at max bitrate: 
	1. MP3 	=> Works so far.
	2. WAV	=> Filter buffer issue in log fixed with CONFIG_AVFILTER=1 in simulator. Broken on HW.
	3. OGG	=> System crash with all files tested. => Enabled MDCT in FFmpeg, works in sim & HW.
	4. FLAC	=> Seems to work. Track position stays at 0:00 in client => Works in simulator.
	5. APE	=> ?
	6. WMA	=> System crash like with Ogg. => Enabled MDCT in FFmpeg, works in sim. HW: ?
	7. AAC	=> ?
	
Notes:
	- Simulator is the WalkFox Sim, with local read-out of meta data & position info.
	- Position keeps getting reset to 0:00 by NCA update in client with OGG & FLAC.
	- WAV gives the abuffersink error in log, then playback hangs until stopped.

2. Playback of various video formats (video & audio streams, audio-only output):
	1. MKV
	2. AVI
	3. WEBM (MKV derivative).
	4. MP4
	5.

Criteria:
	1. Smooth playback, no audio artefacts.

== T1. Multi-room ==

1. Connect to multiple NCA-ESP32 instances.
2. Play back media formats as per T0.1.1 & T0.1.2 with T0.1 criteria.
3. Use 1+ NCA-ESP32 as slaves with a non-NCA-ESP32 NymphCast server as master:
	a. With regular playback.
	b. With NymphCast Apps.

Additional criteria:
	1. Synchronisation between the different NCA-ESP32 instances.
